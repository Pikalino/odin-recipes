        <h1>Chilaquiles Breakfast Casserole</h1>
        <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/sMtCxjGcLq1WY44kHHFE67Rnv5A=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/8684756_Chilaquiles-Breakfast-Casserole_John-Mitzewich_4x3-0253b6d6684e49bb97e53665b73d531c.jpg"alt="Chilaquiles Breakfast Casserole">
        <p>This chilaquiles breakfast casserole is made with layered tortilla chips, baked in a spiced chile sauce and cheese. Topped with fried or poached eggs, and plenty of delicious fixings, it's very satisfying. Traditional chilaquiles are made in a skillet, but this casserole version is a great way to serve a large group at breakfast or a brunch.</p>

        <p>*1 (20 ounce) can red enchilada sauce</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
